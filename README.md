# Sven-Version-1

Sven smart vending machine

For my Sven upgrades I created a Ascii art that spelled out the name Sven that you can see below. ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together that uses characters defined by the ASCII Standard. By using some of Mr. Minich's code I was able to creat a exit method. The exit method was made so you could exit the program when ever needed. You can see the code and the Ascii art here:

With the help from my classmates, I was able to build off of them. Cooper M made a ASCII art vending machine that looked amazing.  Jack H added color to the whole project which made it look cool. Justin k added a secret game in the code that you have to type a secret passcode to play. The passcode is hidden in the ASCII art vending machine by the way.
