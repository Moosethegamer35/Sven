# Sven-Version-1

Sven smart vending machine

For my Sven upgrades I created a Ascii art that spelled out the name Sven that you can see below. I also added a more advanced exit method that my fellow classmates built off of. If you dont know what ASCII art is, while its a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together that uses characters defined by the ASCII Standard. By using some of Mr. Minich's code I was able to create an exit method. The exit method was made so you could exit the program when ever needed. You can see the code and the Ascii art here:

I used the website https://www.kammerl.de/ascii/AsciiSignature.php to creat the ASCII art Sven letters. I chose the best letters that I thought would make the letters look amazing. With the help from my classmates, I was able to build off of them. Cooper M made a ASCII art vending machine that looked amazing.  Jack H added color to the whole project which made it look cool. Justin k added a secret game in the code that you have to type a secret passcode to play. The passcode is hidden in the ASCII art vending machine by the way.
