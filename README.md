# Sven-Version-1

Sven smart vending machine

For my Sven upgrades I created a Ascii art that spelled out the name Sven that you can see below. ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together that uses characters defined by the ASCII Standard. By using some of Mr. Minich's code I was able to creat a exit method. The exit method was made so you could exit the program when ever needed. You can see the code and the Ascii art here:
